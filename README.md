# Novi Sad Relational Tech (NSRT)

Tools crafted by, with, and for Novi Sad residents — made to help us connect, care for, and trust each other.

Inspired by the [Relational Tech Project](https://www.relationaltechproject.org/).

## What is relational technology?

Relational technology refers to digital tools that strengthen local connections and community bonds. Rather than one-size-fits-all platforms, these are tools built with deep awareness of the specific challenges and opportunities in our community.

## Why Novi Sad?

Novi Sad has a rich cultural fabric and engaged residents, but like many cities, could benefit from better tools for neighborhood connection, resource sharing, and collective action.

## Tool Ideas

### Neighborhood Connection

1. **Komsiluk** (komšiluk = neighborhood) — A hyper-local board for your building or block. Post asks/offers (need a drill for an hour, have extra ajvar, looking for someone to walk my dog). Not a city-wide platform — scoped to your immediate neighbors.

2. **Skill/Time Exchange** — A simple directory where residents list what they can teach/share and what they'd like to learn. Think: guitar lessons for help with taxes, Serbian practice for English practice. No currency — just matching.

3. **Dvorište Sessions** (courtyard sessions) — A lightweight tool to organize and discover casual neighborhood gatherings (courtyard coffees, block parties, shared meals). One step below "events" — more like open invitations.

### Civic & Local

4. **Prijavi Problem** (report a problem) — Geotagged reporting for local issues (broken streetlight, pothole on Bulevar, full trash bins in Liman park). Aggregates reports and makes them visible to neighbors and local government.

5. **Participatory Budgeting Lite** — Simple voting/deliberation tool for mesna zajednica (local community) level decisions. "How should we spend the neighborhood improvement budget?"

6. **Public Space Tracker** — Map and track the status of Novi Sad's public spaces (parks, playgrounds, riverfront areas). Who maintains them? What's their condition? Community-sourced updates.

### Culture & Local Economy

7. **Local First Directory** — A curated, community-maintained directory of local businesses, craftspeople, and services. Not Google Maps reviews — more like neighborhood recommendations with personal context.

8. **Kulturni Radar** — Aggregate and surface the many small cultural events that happen across Novi Sad (gallery openings, book readings, jam sessions, theater) that get lost across Instagram stories and Facebook groups.

9. **Community Library / Tool Library** — A catalog of things neighbors are willing to lend (books, tools, camping gear, kitchen equipment). Track what's available and who has it.

### Mutual Aid

10. **Solidarity Network** — Coordinate mutual aid during heat waves, cold snaps, or floods (Novi Sad's proximity to the Danube makes this relevant). Who needs help? Who can provide it? What resources are available?

## Getting Involved

This project is open to anyone who lives in or cares about Novi Sad. Whether you're a developer, designer, organizer, or simply a curious neighbor — there's a place for you here.
